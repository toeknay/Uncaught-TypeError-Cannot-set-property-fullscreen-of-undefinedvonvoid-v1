                        <h1>Community Code of Conduct</h1>
                        <p>Last updated: November 28, 2018 | <a href="/legal/terms">Terms</a> | <a href="/legal/privacy">Privacy & Data</a> </p>
                        <p>The Spiffy Community is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, or religion (or lack thereof). Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication, and we do not tolerate harassment in any form.</p>

                        <p>This Code of Conduct applies to all Spiffy Community spaces, including the Spiffy Google Group, the Spiffy Community Slack, Spiffy open source repositories, and Spiffy Community events and meetups, online and offline, as well as in one-on-one communications pertaining to Spiffy Community business. Participants violating our Code of Conduct may be penalized or expelled at the discretion of community moderators.</p>

                        <p>Some Spiffy Community spaces may have additional rules in place, which are posted publicly for participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. We invite all those who participate in the Spiffy Community to help us create safe and positive community experiences.</p>

                        <p>Consequences for noncompliance with the Code of Conduct may include a discussion with moderators, mediation with the participant you may have harassed, or as an absolute last resort, a ban from the community.</p>

                                <h2 class="mt-5">Additional Items</h2>
                                <p>Please also note:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Moderators can choose to close threads or ask for a subject change.</li>
                                    <li>Moderators can choose to re-evaluate consequences.</li>
                                    <li>Do not delete posts or comments you’ve made unless:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>You sincerely made the post in error (like accidentally posting in the wrong group, for example) and</li>
                                            <li>Deleting will not interfere with group discussion. The specific problem we want to address with this rule: Deleting because the conversation has become tense or uncomfortable or to avoid taking responsibility is. Many of us are socialized or naturally prone to avoid conflict, but working through that conflict and acknowledging differing viewpoints is worth the discomfort.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>This Code of Conduct applies to Spiffy Community spaces and events, but if you are being or have been harassed by a Spiffy Community participant externally, you may still report to the Spiffy Community moderators. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by community participants seriously. The Spiffy Community moderators reserve the right to exclude people from the Spiffy Community and/or Spiffy events based on past and/or external behavior towards Spiffy Community participants or non-participants.</li>
                                    <li>We will not name harassment victims without their consent. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Spiffy Community or the general public.</li>
                                </ul>
